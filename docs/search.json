    "text": "1 Introduction\nLayoffs can have significant and widespread effects on individuals, communities, and the economy as a whole. This is particularly pertinent for current students who are navigating the job market and assessing future career prospects. Our goal is to unveil the nuanced reality behind layoffs, posing essential questions to empower individuals in their career planning, assist businesses in shaping effective strategies, and guide policymakers in addressing challenges tied to workforce transitions and economic uncertainties.\nKey questions we aim to address include:\n\nIndustry Resilience:\n\n\nWhich industries or sectors are experiencing the highest levels of layoffs? Which industries are more affected by layoffs and which ones are more robust to the economic conditions?\n\n\nGeographic Dynamics:\n\n\nHow do layoff rates vary across different geographic regions?\nCan we discern disparities in layoff rates between urban and rural areas?\n\n\nEconomic and Market Correlation:\n\n\nHow do layoff rates correlate with market and economic indicators?\nIs the unemployment rate also consistent with the observed layoff data?\n\n\nTemporal Trends:\n\n\nWhat is the historical trend of layoffs across different years?\nAre there discernible patterns or cycles in layoff data, and how closely do these align with broader market trends and stock market data?\n\n\nNotice period:\n\n\nWhat is the typical notice period provided to employees facing layoffs?\nAre employees awarded sufficient time to explore alternative opportunities, and how can this impact their transition?\n\n\nReason for Layoffs:\n\n\nWhat was the major reason for layoffs? Which reasons were more common than the others?\n\nBy addressing these questions, our analysis seeks to provide a comprehensive understanding of the layoff landscape, offering insights that can inform proactive career choices, strategic business decisions, and effective policy interventions. This knowledge is crucial for navigating the complexities of a dynamic job market and fostering resilience in the face of economic changes."

    "text": "2.1 Technical Description\nThe datasets we are using for our project are as follows:\n\nLayoff Data: https://layoffdata.com/data/\n\n\nCollected by: Rajat Gupta\nDownloaded from a spreadsheet\nFormat of the data: excel spreadsheet with the following features:\n\nState\nCompany\nCity\nNumber of Workers laid off\nReceived Date - date when the notice was received\nEffective Date - date of leaving\nLayoff/Closure Type - reason for layoff\nUnion - union to which workers belonged to if any\nRegion\nCounty\nIndustry - type of industry that the company belongs\nNotes - further information on the reason for layoff\nFrequency of updates: Monthly\n\nDimensions of the data: The data consists of 50218 rows and 13 columns.\nIssues/problems with the data: There are two columns in the data namely: ‘Layoff/ClosureType’ and ‘Temporary/Permanent’ which have coinciding values of the reason for layoff. We will pick one which is more explanatory of the layoff cause.\n\n\nUnemployment Rate Data: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE\n\n\nCollected by: Jagriti Hirwani\nDownload as an excel file available on the website\nFormat of the data : .xls file with the following features\n\nObservation date: date on which the unemployment rate was taken\nRate of unemployment\n\nFrequency of update: Monthly\nDimensions of the data: the data has 910 rows and 2 columns\nOther relevant information: the data consists monthly employment rate from January 1984 - October 2023\nIssues/problems with the data: there is no problem with the data, we will trim the data to accommodate recent years as we do not need unemployment rates as old as 1984.\n\n\nStock market data: https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/index/SPX/historical-prices\n\n\nCollected by Jagriti Hirwani\nDownloaded as a csv file\nFormat of the data: .csv file with the following features:\n\nDate\nOpen - opening prices for the day\nHigh - highest price of the day\nLow - lowest price of the day\n\nClose - closing prices for the day\nFrequency of the data: Daily\nDimensions of the data: The data has 4089 rows and 5 columns\nOther relevant information: The data ranges from September 2007 to November 2023\n\nPlan to import the data: We have downloaded the data from the sources mentioned above and will be using it in our R workspace for further analysis."

    "text": "2.2 Research Plan\nCommencing our analysis, we will direct our attention to current layoff statistics over time, with the aim of understanding prevailing trends in the job market landscape. If current layoff data shows a notable increase, we can reasonably infer a potentially challenging job market scenario.\nSimultaneously, we will conduct a comparative analysis with key US stock indices, particularly the S&P 500, to identify potential correlations with market performance. We anticipate a negative correlation, suggesting that a sluggish market performance may coincide with an uptick in current job terminations as organizations strive to optimize expenditures amidst reduced business activity.\nDeepening our inquiry, our objective will be to identify patterns that could serve as indicators for current trajectories. Leveraging current layoff data, we will systematically identify sectors experiencing higher instances of workforce reduction. With a focus on the period from 2018 to 2023, encompassing the last five years, we acknowledge the challenge of comparing raw layoff numbers across industries due to variations in total employment. Therefore, our approach will involve an intra-industry comparison over time, aiming to distill trends that may identify the most impacted sectors. Conversely, industries with a relative absence of pronounced spikes in current layoffs may be considered more resilient in economic downturns.\nExpanding our analysis, we will shift focus to a geographically nuanced examination of trends within the current US landscape. This aims to determine whether specific states or regions bear a disproportionate burden of current layoffs. Integrating current regional data with industry-specific metrics will provide insights into whether certain industries within particular states face more challenging economic circumstances.\nContinuing our trajectory, we will examine the current temporal dynamics of layoffs, looking at the pace at which organizations are implementing workforce reductions. Analyzing the time organizations are affording employees to adapt to impending layoffs across diverse industries, we will also consider state-by-state variations to understand the influence of current regional legislative frameworks.\nExamining the causative factors behind current layoffs available in data, we will undertake a meticulous analysis to identify predominant factors shaping current workforce reduction scenarios. This investigative phase, adopting a region-wise and state-wise lens, will aim to discern nuanced patterns that may emerge.\nFinally, our analysis will integrate unemployment rate data to understand the post-layoff trajectories of affected individuals. This examination seeks to ascertain whether individuals subjected to current layoffs will transition swiftly into alternative employment or contribute to an uptick in current unemployment rates by remaining unemployed."
