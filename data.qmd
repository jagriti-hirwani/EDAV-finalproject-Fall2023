## Technical Description

The datasets we are using for our project are as follows:

1) Layoff Data: https://layoffdata.com/data/
  - Collected by: WARN Database which have citations from various sources mentioned here: https://layoffdata.com/cited/
  - Downloaded from a spreadsheet
  - Format of the data: excel spreadsheet with the following features:
    - State 
    - Company
    - City 
    - Number of Workers laid off
    - Received Date - date when the notice was received
    - Effective Date - date of leaving
    - Layoff/Closure Type - reason for layoff
    - Union - union to which workers belonged to if any
    - Region 
    - County
    - Industry - type of industry that the company belongs
    - Notes - further information on the reason for layoff
    - Frequency of updates: Monthly
  - Dimensions of the data: The data consists of 50218 rows and 13 columns.
  - Issues/problems with the data:
    There are two columns in the data namely: â€˜Layoff/Closure\n Type' and 'Temporary/Permanent' which have coinciding values     of the reason for layoff. We will pick one which is more explanatory of the layoff cause.
    
2) Unemployment Rate Data: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE
  - Collected by Federal Reserve Economic Data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics
  - Download as an excel file available on the website

    - Observation date: date on which the unemployment rate was taken
    - Rate of unemployment
  - Frequency of update: Monthly
  - Dimensions of the data: the data has 910 rows and 2 columns
  - Other relevant information: the data consists monthly employment rate from January 1984 - October 2023
  - Issues/problems with the data: there is no problem with the data, we will trim the data to accommodate recent years as we     do not need unemployment rates as old as 1984.
  
3) Stock market data: https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/index/SPX/historical-prices
  - Collected by the Wall Street Journal
  - Downloaded as a csv file 
  - Format of the data: .csv file with the following features:
    - Date 
    - Open - opening prices for the day
    - High - highest price of the day
    - Low - lowest price of the day

  - Other relevant information: The data ranges from September 2007 to November 2023
  
Plan to import the data: We have downloaded the data from the sources mentioned above and will be using it in our R workspace for further analysis.


## Research Plan

Commencing our analysis, we will direct our attention to current layoff statistics over time, with the aim of understanding prevailing trends in the job market landscape. If current layoff data shows a notable increase, we can reasonably infer a potentially challenging job market scenario.

Simultaneously, we will conduct a comparative analysis with key US stock indices, particularly the S&P 500, to identify potential correlations with market performance. We anticipate a negative correlation, suggesting that a sluggish market performance may coincide with an uptick in current job terminations as organizations strive to optimize expenditures amidst reduced business activity.

Deepening our inquiry, our objective will be to identify patterns that could serve as indicators for current trajectories. Leveraging current layoff data, we will systematically identify sectors experiencing higher instances of workforce reduction. With a focus on the period from 2018 to 2023, encompassing the last five years, we acknowledge the challenge of comparing raw layoff numbers across industries due to variations in total employment. Therefore, our approach will involve an intra-industry comparison over time, aiming to distill trends that may identify the most impacted sectors. Conversely, industries with a relative absence of pronounced spikes in current layoffs may be considered more resilient in economic downturns.

Expanding our analysis, we will shift focus to a geographically nuanced examination of trends within the current US landscape. This aims to determine whether specific states or regions bear a disproportionate burden of current layoffs. Integrating current regional data with industry-specific metrics will provide insights into whether certain industries within particular states face more challenging economic circumstances.

Continuing our trajectory, we will examine the current temporal dynamics of layoffs, looking at the pace at which organizations are implementing workforce reductions. Analyzing the time organizations are affording employees to adapt to impending layoffs across diverse industries, we will also consider state-by-state variations to understand the influence of current regional legislative frameworks.

Examining the causative factors behind current layoffs available in data, we will undertake a meticulous analysis to identify predominant factors shaping current workforce reduction scenarios. This investigative phase, adopting a region-wise and state-wise lens, will aim to discern nuanced patterns that may emerge.

Finally, our analysis will integrate unemployment rate data to understand the post-layoff trajectories of affected individuals. This examination seeks to ascertain whether individuals subjected to current layoffs will transition swiftly into alternative employment or contribute to an uptick in current unemployment rates by remaining unemployed.
