# Introduction

Layoffs can have significant and widespread effects on individuals, communities, and the economy as a whole. This is particularly pertinent for current students who are navigating the job market and assessing future career prospects. Our goal is to unveil the nuanced reality behind layoffs, posing essential questions to empower individuals in their career planning, assist businesses in shaping effective strategies, and guide policymakers in addressing challenges tied to workforce transitions and economic uncertainties.

Key questions we aim to address include:

1) Industry Resilience:
  - Which industries or sectors are experiencing the highest levels of layoffs? Which industries are more affected by layoffs and which ones are more robust to the economic conditions?
2) Geographic Dynamics:
  - How do layoff rates vary across different geographic regions? 
  - Can we discern disparities in layoff rates between urban and rural areas?
3) Economic and Market Correlation:
  - How do layoff rates correlate with market and economic indicators? 
  - Is the unemployment rate also consistent with the observed layoff data?
4) Temporal Trends: 
  - What is the historical trend of layoffs across different years?
  - Are there discernible patterns or cycles in layoff data, and how closely do these align with broader market trends and       stock market data?
5) Notice period: 
  - What is the typical notice period provided to employees facing layoffs? 
  - Are employees awarded sufficient time to explore alternative opportunities, and how can this impact their transition?
6) Reason for Layoffs:
  - What was the major reason for layoffs? Which reasons were more common than the others?
  
By addressing these questions, our analysis seeks to provide a comprehensive understanding of the layoff landscape, offering insights that can inform proactive career choices, strategic business decisions, and effective policy interventions. This knowledge is crucial for navigating the complexities of a dynamic job market and fostering resilience in the face of economic changes.
